This is a Sample code for demo purposes. Current code is part of my underdevelopment project.
I am reponsible for coding project alone but the design is done by an other person.


Project Quick Details:

Project is called MixPicks and it in CakePHP. MixPicks is music site where Artists can upload their mixes and Members can buy them online. Administrator will manage the whole website.
There will be three users Artists, Members and Admin.

Note: These files are not how they are in project. Different parts from different controllers are combined to show coding potential.
